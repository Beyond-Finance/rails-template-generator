**TODO:**

- Add your plugin code to lib/GEM_NAME.rb and lib/GEM_NAME/ and add any gems you may need in dependencies in GEM_NAME.gemspec
- Add to the `attr_accessor` list and set defaults as instance variables for anything a consumer application should configure in lib/GEM_NAME/configuration.rb
- Update the template in lib/generators/templates/GEM_NAME.rb for these configuration values; this file will be copied to the config/initializers directory of a consumer app running `bin/rails g GEM_NAME:install`
- Clean up this file and document how consumers should use your plugin!
